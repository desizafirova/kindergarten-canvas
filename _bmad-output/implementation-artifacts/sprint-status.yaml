#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file

# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created

# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

# FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (to be scheduled)
# =====================================
# These items were identified during development but deferred for future stories:
#
# - scroll-to-top-on-navigation: Add ScrollToTop component to automatically scroll
#   to top when navigating between pages. Currently some pages don't scroll to top
#   when accessed via hamburger menu navigation. (Identified during Story 1.1 review)
